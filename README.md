## Introduction

[mev-boost](https://boost.flashbots.net/) introduced a way for the entire Ethereum network to 
verify if a Proposer used a block sent by a Relay without having modified it - remember that a 
proposer commits to use the most profitable payload sent by the relay and only this one.

This is possible because the Relays which implement the Data Transparency API expose these 
payloads. Once they have been proposed, we can compare those two and check if they match or not.

## Nonx

Nonx is a project focused on exposing if the Proposers using mev-boost break their commitments 
of using the payload they received from the Relays.
This can be the case when a Proposer decides to use the most profitable block it received and 
extract more value for itself.

## Usage

First, you must either set a few environment variable values using the ones provided in the [`.envrc.example`](./.envrc.example)
file or set the corresponding values in the [`config.example.json`](./config.example.json) or 
[`config.example.yaml`](./config.example.yaml) file.

Then, run the following command to build the project:
```shell
make all
```

### Single slot verification

To start a single analysis of a given slot, use the following command (don't provide the 
`--slot` flag if you already set it in the environment / configuration file):
```shell
./nonx verify --slot <SLOT_NUMBER>
```

Example:
```shell
$ - ./nonx verify --slot 5253886
INFO[0000] ‚úÖ commitment has been respected by proposer   committed_payload_hash=0xcffee69df32c924ff2de6a3975b52ce69208c540e7afd8f9cdc9b7efac119cff proposed_payload_hash=0xcffee69df32c924ff2de6a3975b52ce69208c540e7afd8f9cdc9b7efac119cff slot=5253886
```

### Watcher

To run the watcher, which will verify every new payload delivered by the relay to the proposers, 
run the following command:
```
./nonx watch
```

Example:
```shell
$ - ./nonx watch
INFO[0000] ‚úÖ commitment has been respected by proposer   committed_payload_hash=0x255ccbf4e495d768ce453d30f2ae7050ed7123d24bf3d5e1b24940ab5908b499 proposed_payload_hash=0x255ccbf4e495d768ce453d30f2ae7050ed7123d24bf3d5e1b24940ab5908b499 slot=5280458

```

## Limitations

The current implementation can produce wrong results because the beacon client you might use can 
take some time to get the latest proposed block, which would lead to the analysis to fail 
(comparing the relay delivered payload to an empty hash).
